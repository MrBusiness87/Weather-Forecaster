# Weather-HW6

This app is very easy to use, type in a city that you would like to know the weather for and then click on the search button. Then it will tell you the current forecast to the right of the search bar.

Below all of the above, the 5-Day Forecast is displayed.

If you decided to compare cities, it is as easy as clicking the city that you searched previously below the search button itself.

Hope you can use this to figure out your next 5 Days Outside!!!
